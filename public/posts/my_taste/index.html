				<h2 id="what-is-a-favorite-to-me">What is a &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; to me?</h2>
<p>I wanted to write this post about my favorites for 2 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>This will serve as a reference point for my views in any later posts</li>
<li>I wanted an excuse to put down thoughts and feelings that I have long held but never really expressed anywhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, how does something make it into my list of favorites? If it is on this list, it is a series that holds great nostalgia for me, is still a part of my life on a regular basis, or is something that I have such fond memories of my time reading / watching / playing that I often remember it and go back to the media itself, or its adjacent materials i.e. video essays, articles, spin-offs.</p>
<p>I hate the ranking out of 10 system that sites like letterboxd and MyAnimeList employ because when you are watching media just to rank it, I feel like you are clouding your impressions. You can gain something out of a movie, whether that is fun or just finding something where you disagree with the norm, by not always sticking to objectively &ldquo;good&rdquo; stuff. It is a bit ironic, as I do realize that most of the stuff on my list falls into the &ldquo;objectively good&rdquo; as defined by their respectice communities. I am not immune to the social pressures of ranking, however and interestingly enough found that many of the things on my list I had not personally rated 10/10s or 9/10s at the time despite how fondly I remember them now.</p>
<p>I am going to keep it to one instance of a story, regardless of medium. Otherwise, I would probably have multiple instances of Steins; Gate, Berserk, and Hunter x Hunter, maybe more on my list. If I really like a story, I will often pursue it in all it&rsquo;s forms as I am sort of a completion.</p>

<p><strong>Perfect Blue</strong></p>
<p>I will get into this later, but I am a big David Lynch head. At the risk of being contrived, Satoshi Kon&rsquo;s works feel &ldquo;Lynchian&rdquo; to me with Perfect Blue being my favorite. Perfect Blue employs a lot of classic Lynch tropes like the blurring of reality, themes of split identity, and dreams. Kon&rsquo;s other works like Millenium Actress are also fantastic. I have a number that I haven&rsquo;t seen that I plan to watch soon.</p>
<p><strong>Mushishi</strong></p>
<p>Mushishi has been a comfort show for me ever since I first watched it. I like it so much I have a tattoo! This is one of the series that I would easily put the Manga and Anime on my list. Yuki Urushibara&rsquo;s art is incredibly beautiful. The sound design of the Anime is why it is here and not the Manga. Ginko became one of my favorite fictional characters because of his attitude toward the world and the mushi. He floats through the world, not particularly in any hurry. He emphasizes to people that despite bad things that may be happening to them because of the mushi, it is just the natural order of things and has taken a policy of not harming them whenever possible. One of my favorite moments is in &ldquo;Raindrops and Rainbows&rdquo; when Ginko is talking to Koro, the man chasing after Rainbows. He emphasizes the need for taking a break to a man who clearly needs one. Taking a break is just important as working</p>
<p><strong>Akira</strong></p>
<p>Akira has everything that I think is cool. An incredibly interesting score, sci-fi mixed with mysticism, corrupt politicians, military coups, dystopia. It is a movie I find myself rewatching frequently. It was ahead of it&rsquo;s time technically, and thematically I think, making iit quite timeless.</p>
<p><strong>Serial Experiments Lain</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neon Genesis Evangelion</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gintama</strong></p>
<p><strong>Haibane Renmei</strong></p>
<p><strong>Texhnolyze</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arakawa Under the Bridge</strong></p>
<p>This is another comfort show to me. It is a comedy with themes of friendship and found family. It makes me feel incredibly good watching it, and on top of that the show has incredible openings.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Hunter S. Thompson</strong></p>
<p><strong>Avatar the Last Airbender</strong></p>
<p>This is both a nostalgia pick for me, and something that I think has held up incredibly well. I rewatched ATLA again after it being probably 10 years since the last time I watched it, and it was still incredible. Uncle Iroh will remain one of my favorite characters in all of fiction. I wish I could have a cup of tea with him.</p>
<p><strong>David Lynch</strong></p>
<p><strong>Twin Peaks</strong></p>
<p><strong>Blade Runner</strong></p>
<p>Blade Runner was the first movie to scratch what I talked about Akira doing. The &ldquo;tears in the rain&rdquo; monologue is quite possibly my favorite thing in a movie ever. I love the neo-noir dystopian setting that the film creates. 2049 was an incredibly worthy sequel. The themes of this movie were incredibly ahead of its time.</p>
<p><strong>Memories of Murder</strong></p>
<p>This movie is very funny and very dark all at the same time. I was first introduced to Bong Joon Ho with Parasite, his film that garnered international success, but this is the one that made me love him. It took me a rewatch to &ldquo;get&rdquo; it, but now it is one of my favorite movies. The film was released before the serial killer the film was based on was caught and reflected the grim attitudes toward the situation. One of the best endings ever.</p>
