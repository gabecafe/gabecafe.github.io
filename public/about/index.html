				<p><strong>So, why does this blog exist?</strong></p>
<p>The short answer is, I want to encourage myself to be a more conscious and thoughtful consumer of the things that I enjoy. There is no sense in making listening to music or watching anime a chore, but there is something to be gained by doing the things we enjoy more intentionally, and reflecting on those things, instead of going on autopilot and  consuming mindlessly. I catch myself falling into cycles where I &ldquo;reel hole&rdquo; and watch YouTube Shorts, or Reels on Instagram, short form content that often gives quick hits of dopamine, but that I rarely get anything out of in the long run. In fact, I feel that those forms of media are actively harmful to my day to day, presenting me with content that has such a low barrier to entry I end up consuming it over doing anything else, or just flat out ending up angry or upset because of something I have seen. I am on a journey to better regulate what I consume and make more time for myself to consume what I love.</p>
<p><strong>What will be contained on this blog?</strong></p>
<p>I have a lot of interests, and there are often things that fade in and out that may appear here, but there will be some constants. You can expect at the very least for me to write about music, anime, and my collection of media (both physical and digital). I also occasionally play some games, but that has taken more of a backseat lately. I have designs to write about the status of my record, manga, and art book collections, a regular series of post keeping up with my current media consumption, and maybe some long form posts analyzing artists or pieces of media I am into at the moment. I am going to keep it open as I want this space to be an enabler to my hobbies, not something that takes away from it.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this site look like it does?</strong></p>
<p>The site is created using a static site generator called Hugo<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and intentionally using as few resources as possible. No external scripts or fonts, just HTML and CSS. This is made possible using the &ldquo;smol&rdquo; theme<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. I wanted the purpose of this site to remain on it&rsquo;s content and not have to worry about hosting and maintaining dependencies. This site is hosted on Github Pages<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and built using Github Actions meaning the process of adding a new post is as simple as editing a markdown file and committing to my GitHub repository<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
